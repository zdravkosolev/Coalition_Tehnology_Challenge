This submission represents my skills test for the front-end position at Coalition Technologies. The objective of this assessment is to evaluate my capability to transform an Adobe Photoshop file into a static, single-page web application. The primary goal is to convert the provided PSD into a responsive single-page website. This entails ensuring that the carousel seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, and on mobile devices, the tabs should gracefully transition into an accordion layout for improved usability. Tools used for this project: jQuery, HTML, Bootstrap
